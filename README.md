Planarity is a mathematical brain teaser that challenges the player to transform a graph into its planar representation. It is built entirely in JavaScript and utilizes jQuery and Canvas to interact with the player. [Planar Graphs][planar-wiki] are sets of edges and vertices where the edges intersect only at their endpoints.

## Features & Implementation

### Graph Generation Algorithm

The game generates a new random graph at the beginning of each level. Determining whether a graph is planar is a non-trivial matter, so I used a
